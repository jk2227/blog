Congrats on somehow landing on this page! I am guessing if you are here, you want to learn a little bit about me... so here's a short bio :)

My name is Ji Hun Kim and I am currently a Software Engineer at Google working in Mountain View, CA. I was born in Seoul, South Korea but came to the US when I was 8. I grew up in the suburbs of Northern Virginia (McLean, VA to be more specific), went to TJHSST for high school, and went to Cornell University after, where I studied Computer Science (and minored in Information Science) and obtained a M. Eng. and a B.S. in 4 years.

I never grew up dreaming of becoming a Software Engineer or studying Computer Science. Instead, I grew up dreaming of becoming a soccer player (like every Korean kid who watched the 2002 World Cup), and even applied to my high school because their soccer program won the state title while I was in middle school. Going into college, I had no idea what I wanted to major in, but ended up really liking all the CS classes I took and everyone in the Cornell CS community.

During my college years, I was heavily involved in a student org called ACSU and spent a lot of time as a TA and teaching a 1-credit supplemental course. I ended up interning at Cvent, Amazon, and Microsoft before eventually ending up on Google as a Software Engineer.

In my free time, I like to play/watch/talk about soccer and basketball, watch old episodes of 무한도전 (Infinite Challenge), and take nice walks around my neighborhood. I am a big Chelsea FC fan and enjoy following the struggles of the Washington Wizards.

I plan to post a lot of random things on this space, from topics ranging from computer science, software engineering, sports, and random thoughts about adult life! Hope you enjoy whatever content I put here :)
